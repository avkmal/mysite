      <description>I’ve just finished R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and just started Text mining With R by Julia Silge. So I figured it’s about time i do some data analysis to apply the skills I learned. I decided to do sentiment analysis after reading this post by Julia Silge.
After skimming through some interesting datasets on the internet, i decided to use ’A Million Headlines` dataset which can be found on Kaggle.</description>
