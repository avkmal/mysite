      <description>I’ve just finished R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham, and i figured it’s about time i do some analysis to apply the skills I learned. I decided to do sentiment analysis after reading this post by Julia Silge.
After skimming through some interesting datasets on the internet, i decided to use ’A Million Headlines` dataset which can be found on Kaggle. It’s a dataset of news headlines published over a period of 14 years from 2003 to 2017 taken from Australian news source ABC(Australian Broadcasting Group).</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
