Hi! My name is Akmal and i'm currently working as Associate Data Scientist at The Center of Applied Data Science. I built this blog so that it can be a platform for me to practice analyzing data and communicating about it.
This blog is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the help of [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package in R and deployed with [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
