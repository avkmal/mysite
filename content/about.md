My name is Akmal Abdul Rashid and i am currently an engineering student at International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), majoring in manufacturing. I expects to graduate in january 2018. I built this blog so that it can be a platform for me to practice analyzing data and communicating about it.

This blog is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the help of [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package in R.
